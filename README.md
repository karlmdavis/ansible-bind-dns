![Travis CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/karlmdavis/ansible-tested-bind.svg)

Requirements
------------

This role supports Ansible 2 and later on the development system, and requires Ubuntu Server 16.04 on systems that the role is applied to.

Role Variables
--------------

This role can be configured by altering the variables listed in this section. See [defaults/main.yml](defaults/main.yml) for information on what the default vaules for these are.

The primary configuration variable is the `zones` list. It specifies the zones that will be served by BIND, as well as the source [template files](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/template_module.html) that will be used to create the zone DB files.

```
zones:
  - {name: 'foo.com', template_source: 'db.foo.com.j2'}
  - {name: 'bar.com', template_source: 'db.bar.com.j2'}
```

Dependencies
------------

This role does not have dependencies on other Ansible roles.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: username.rolename, x: 42 }
